# Predicting Medical Appointment No-Shows in Brazil

## Introduction
In this project we investigate a data set of appoinment records in public hospitals in Vitoria, Espirito Santo, Brazil. 
The data includes whether the patient showed up to the appointment, which is the main focus, as well as other attributes of the patient and the appointment.

The data set is provided by JoniHoppen on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/joniarroba/noshowappointments

Our aim is to help to answer the question, "how likely is a patient with certain attributes, to show up to his hospital appointment?" 
We will explore the data and look for relationships between variables, to pave the way for more extensive modeling.
